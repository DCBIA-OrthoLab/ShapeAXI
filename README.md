## Introduction

**ShapeAXI** is a state-of-the-art shape analysis framework that harnesses a multi-view approach. This approach is adept at capturing 3D objects from a variety of viewpoints and analyzing them through 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

---

## Installation

First you have to create a __conda__ environment and activate it:
- Python 3.8, 3.9 or 3.10
```bash
conda create --name "your_new_environment" python=3.X
conda activate "your_new_environment"
```
(replace the X with 8,9 or 10 for the python version you want)    

### Installation of pytorch3d 

Run these lines, 
```bash
conda install pytorch=1.13.0 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
conda install -c bottler nvidiacub
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d
```

Finally, check the installation,
```bash
pip show pytorch3d
```

### Requirements:

```bash
# Command to install ShapeAXI
git clone https://github.com/DCBIA-OrthoLab/ShapeAXI.git
cd ShapeAXI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage:

To get started with **ShapeAXI**, follow the steps below:


#### Example CSV File

Your input CSV file should be structured as follows:

| surf                                 | class  |
|--------------------------------------|--------|
| path/to/shape1.vtk                   | class1 |
| path/to/shape2.stl                   | class2 |
| path/to/shape3.obj                   | class1 |
| ...                                  | ...    |


- **surf**: This column holds the file paths to the 3D shape objects. The tool supports the formats `.vtk`, `.stl`, and `.obj`.
- **class**: This column indicates the class of the 3D object.

### Running ShapeAXI

To use ShapeAXI, execute the `saxi_folds.py` script:

```bash
python saxi_folds.py --csv your_data.csv --compute_scale_factor 1 --surf_column surf --class_column class --subdivision_level 2 --batch_size 8 --out output_dir/
```

Ensure you replace `your_data.csv` with the correct path to your specific CSV file. 

```
